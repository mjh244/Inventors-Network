# Inventors-Network
This is a repo for our class project in our Senior Project class. This repo contains code we used to create an inventors network to predict stock performance.

Required Files:
The inventor dataset is required before running the code. This file is called invpat.zip and it is from from Harvard’s “Disambiguation and Co-authorship Networks of the U.S. Patent Inventor Database (1975 - 2010)”. This file was not uploaded to the repo as it exceeded Github's 100 MB capacity. It can be found at the following link.
